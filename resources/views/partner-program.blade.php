            OneSignal’s in-app messaging feature is fast becoming a go-to when
            needing to deliver important messages to fans. We like this feature as
            it allows an extra level of engagement with the fan while they are
            within our mobile experiences and provides the flexibility to do this
            without the need for any app releases. We are seeing fantastic results
            with fans and sponsors who are enjoying the extra interaction within
            the apps.
