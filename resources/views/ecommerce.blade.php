            The top 25 percent of mobile games have an average monthly retention
            rate of less than 4 percent. Converting players into paying customers
            is also becoming more expensive. Though push notifications have become
            the number one marketing driver for gaming studios, given these
            challenges, they need a smart multi-channel marketing strategy to
            retain their players. Notifications and in-app messaging are major
            drivers of successful onboarding, engagement, and retention. With very
            high engagement rates, SMS is a powerful way to stand out in
            announcing new launches or opportunities and spurring your players to
            action. With more space to communicate all your exciting new
            developments, email is a crucial driver of long-term retention.
            Trusted by over 30,000 Unity apps, OneSignal offers an
            industry-leading self-serve suite to reach your players.

                Timing matters — especially when you’re getting website visitors to
                opt into push notifications. With OneSignal, you can control when a
                user sees push permission prompts based on the number of page views
                or seconds spent on a page (or both), so you always make the request
                at the right time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Delayed push permission prompts improve opt-in rates for
                notifications and help to ensure your messages get in front of your
                target audience.
